# Thumbnail Generator CI/CD and Kubernetes Deployment

## Overview

This project implements a CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes deployment for a Thumbnail Generator application using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The system is designed to automatically build, test, and deploy the application whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Architecture

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Google Cloud Build
- **Container Registry**: Google Artifact Registry
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Object Storage**: MinIO (simulating S3-compatible storage)
- **Database**: MongoDB

The application is split into two main components:
1. API Server: Handles incoming requests and job creation
2. Worker: Processes thumbnail generation jobs

Both components share the same codebase but are deployed as separate containers for scalability.

## Technology Choices and Trade-offs

1. **GCP Services**: Chosen for their seamless integration and managed infrastructure, reducing operational overhead. Trade-off: Potential vendor lock-in.

2. **Kubernetes**: Provides scalability and container orchestration. Trade-off: Increased complexity compared to simpler deployment options.

3. **MinIO**: Used as an S3-compatible storage solution. In production, this could be replaced with GCS for better integration with GCP. Trade-off: Additional component to manage in the development environment.

4. **MongoDB**: Chosen for its flexibility and ease of use. Trade-off: May require more management compared to managed database services.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up a GCP project and enable necessary APIs (Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry).

2. Create a GKE cluster:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters create cogent-cloudbuild --zone us-central1-c
   ```

3. Set up a Cloud Build trigger connected to your GitHub repository.

4. Create an Artifact Registry repository:
   ```
   gcloud artifacts repositories create cogent-repository --repository-format=docker --location=us-central1
   ```

5. Update the `cloudbuild.yaml` file with your project-specific details.

6. Push changes to your GitHub repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

7. Once deployed, you can access the application using the LoadBalancer IP:
   ```
   kubectl get services thumbnail-generator-service
   ```

## Disaster Recovery

1. Ensure all code is committed to the GitHub repository.
2. Recreate the GKE cluster if necessary.
3. Re-run the Cloud Build pipeline to redeploy the application.
4. Restore any necessary data from backups (MongoDB data, MinIO objects).

## Potential Improvements

1. **Autoscaling**: Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for the API and worker deployments. Configure based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: thumbnail-generator-hpa
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: thumbnail-generator
     minReplicas: 2
     maxReplicas: 10
     metrics:
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: cpu
         targetAverageUtilization: 70
   ```

2. **Cost Monitoring**: Utilize GCP's Cost Management tools to analyze and monitor cluster costs. Set up budget alerts and use GKE usage metering for more granular cost tracking.

3. **Data Backups**: 
   - For MongoDB: Set up periodic snapshots or use a tool like mongodump for regular backups.
   - For MinIO: Implement periodic syncs to a GCS bucket for redundancy.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication.
   - Use Secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or GCP Secret Manager for sensitive data.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
   - Implement structured logging and use GCP's Cloud Logging for centralized log management.

6. **CI/CD Improvements**:
   - Implement canary deployments or blue-green deployments for safer releases.
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage, including integration and end-to-end tests.

7. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Use Terraform or Pulumi to manage GCP resources, ensuring reproducibility and version control of infrastructure.

8. **Service Mesh**:
   - Consider implementing Istio for advanced traffic management, security, and observability features.

## Conclusion

This deployment provides a solid foundation for running the Thumbnail Generator application in a scalable and maintainable way. By leveraging GCP services and Kubernetes, we've created a system that can easily scale to meet demand and be extended with additional features and improvements as needed.
